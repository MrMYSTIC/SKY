                What is SKY?
            </h3>

            <p>
                SKY was written with the developer in mind. 
                It adheres to the MVC architectural pattern used in many other software engineering projects. 
                One of the key features of SKY is that it is extremely easy to learn and use. 
                Don't get overwhelmed by "big" and "fancy" frameworks that try to do EVERYTHING. 
                SKY does web apps, and it does it very well. I use SKY for all of my projects because I can
                get up and running in minutes and can start working on what I need to work on, right away.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that you have decided to use SKY, lets make sure you have the minimum requirements to install SKY.
            </p>
            
            <strong>You will need:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>PHP version 5.2.4 or greater</li>
                <li>Apache (Currently only tested on Apache)</li>
                <li>
                    Recommended:
                    <ul>
                        <li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                SKY has only been tested under Ubuntu 12.04 and above and GoDaddy's Linux Hosted Shared servers.
                I will describe how to install SKY in both the Ubuntu version and GoDaddy servers.
            </p>

            <h3>

                Ubuntu Install
            </h3>

            <p>
                Let's clone SKY into a base directory. <small>I usually use <code>/var/www/</code></small><br/>
                Make sure you can write to the <code>/var/www</code> directory before executing the following code!
            </p>
            
<pre><code>user@ubuntumachine: $ cd /var/www
user@ubuntumachine: $ git clone https://github.com/boxman0617/SKY.git skycore
</code></pre>

            <p>
                Now let's make sure you can access SKY from the command line now. Run the following in your terminal:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code>user@ubuntumachine: $ echo -e "export SKYCORE=/var/www/skycore\nexport PATH=$PATH:$SKYCORE/bin" >> ~/.bashrc</code></pre>
            
            <p>
                That will "register" <code>SKYCORE</code> as and the <code>/bin</code> directory in the path of your terminal 
                and allow you to call <code>sky</code>. To test this out do the following:
            </p>

<pre><code>user@ubuntumachine: $ cd /var/www
user@ubuntumachine: $ sky help
</code></pre>
            
            <p>That should show you the current version of SKY that you have installed followed by some useful sky commands.</p>
            
            <h3>
                <a name="installed-what-next" class="anchor" href="#installed-what-next"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
                Installed! What's next?
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                Now that you have installed SKY and you have checked that you can use the <code>sky</code> command, let's 
                create a new app!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We start by running the following command where we want to create the new SKY app 
                <small>For this example we will continue to to work under <code>/var/www</code></small>:
            </p>

<pre><code>user@ubuntumachine: $ cd /var/www
user@ubuntumachine: $ sky new myappname
user@ubuntumachine: $ cd myappname
</code></pre>
    
        <p>
            The <code>sky new myappname</code> will create the initial SKY app structure. 
            You can now point your Apache server to that directory and you will see SKY's initial
            app page.
        </p>

            SKY's App Structure
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Inside your shiny new SKY app you will find the following directories:
        </p>
